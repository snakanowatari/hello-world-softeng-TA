## Introduction of My Pets
I would like to introduce my two cats.
They are brothers, the first is black and the second is white.

- The first cat was named "Koku".
  - Koku is very elegant and intelligent.
  - He is not timid in loud places or places with many people.

- The second cat was named "Miru".
  - Miru is very energetic and has charm.
  - She always seems to be enjoying itself and loves playing with toys and chasing my feet.
